However, many species are still considered endangered including the blue whale, fin whale, and humpback whale, despite efforts to protect them over the last several decades. There are several threats that whales continue to face, most of which are caused by human activity.  Threats include habitat degradation, contaminants, climate and ecosystem change, disturbance from whale watching activities, noise from industrial activities (including oil drilling), illegal whaling or harvest, reduced prey abundance due to overfishing, and oil spills.
